Abstract:
Large language models are increasingly used for patient-facing medical assistance and clinical decision support, but adapting them to clinical dialogue often requires supervision derived from doctor-patient conversations that may contain sensitive information. Conventional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can amplify memorization risks, enabling empirical membership inference and extraction of rare training-set content. We present PrivMedChat, an end-to-end framework for differentially private RLHF (DP-RLHF) for medical dialogue. Our design enforces differential privacy at every training stage that directly accesses dialogue-derived supervision: (i) Differential Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) for medical SFT and (ii) DP-SGD for reward model learning from preference pairs. To limit additional privacy expenditure during alignment, we apply DP-SGD to the PPO actor and critic when operating on dialogue-derived prompts, while the reward model remains fixed after DP training. We also introduce an annotation-free preference construction strategy that pairs physician responses with filtered non-expert generations to produce scalable preference data without clinician labeling. Experiments on medical dialogue benchmarks show that PrivMedChat at $\varepsilon=7$ achieves the highest ROUGE-L of 0.156 among all DP models, reduces clinical hallucinations to 1.4% and harmful advice to 0.4%, and obtains the highest overall score of 2.86 in a 3-model LLM-jury evaluation, while producing membership-inference signals that are near chance (AUC 0.510-0.555).
